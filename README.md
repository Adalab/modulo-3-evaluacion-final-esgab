# Harry Potter Character Catalog

This exercise evaluates the knowledge we have acquired throughout Module 3 of the Web Development Bootcamp at [Adalab](https://adalab.es).

It involves creating a webpage using React that displays a list of Harry Potter characters fetched from an API. Users can filter characters by name, house and other features. Also, each character links to a detailed profile page.

The web app utilizes React components, including:

1. **App**: Main component handling application logic and rendering.
2. **CharacterList**: Displays character cards and manages filters.
3. **CharacterCard**: Represents each character card. Clicking on a card navigates to the character's detailed profile page.
4. **CharacterDetail**: Shows detailed information about a character.

We fetch character data from an external API and use HTML, CSS, and routing tools alongside React for development.

Explore the magical world of Harry Potter characters and enjoy the experience!
